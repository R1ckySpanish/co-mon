This project provides an automated configuration for monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus-compatible tools. It includes a Jinja2 template for generating a Prometheus scrape configuration file, supporting dynamic discovery of targets and integration with VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, and custom exporters. The setup is designed for flexible deployment in virtualized environments, leveraging Ansible variables for host-specific and environment-specific customization. This enables efficient collection and aggregation of metrics for observability and performance analysis.
